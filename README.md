zero sum game skeleton with a-b cutoffs and matrix game implementation in old C#


This project is an example of how to use a-b cutoffs in a zero sum game. In fact, it includes a generic template such that if implemented 
by a game it will take care of computing the next best move. Old style AI. How old? I originally developed the first version of this skeleton back in 1996 in C++ as a high school project.
The project also includes an implementation of such a game called "Matix"...in which i also went further back in `07 and add a mechanism trying
to predict which AI level would best fit a certain player, and a system for playing the game in ones intranet.
Oh those jolly times.

Putting this in github so this lovely piece sentimantelity has a lesser chance of being lost.
